Use this script when you have a www page with the list of downloadable 
links and want to download all/some of them using GetRight.

The script assumes that you have a file, each line of which containing a link(s)
to file you want to download. Such file may be produced, for examle, if You open 
some html file and issue a command : 

:gl /href=".*zip"/ . write! >> files.grx
:e files.grx

When loaded, the script loads and maps following functions :
1. UnHref() - which removes everything except URLs themselves, and puts every URL on a single line
2. Ability to set the destination directory
3. MakeList() - Function that converts pure URLs to GetRight acceptable information - before invoking it,
each line should contain pure single URL.
